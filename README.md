## Software and code is functional and secure by following industry standard practices and incorporatig features such as encapsulation, helper methods and three-layer-architecture methodolgiy.

## User needs is assessed by listing what functionality is required off the application and ensuring those appectance criterias are fullfilled. Unit tests that specificly target those requirements are also included.

## My approach to designing the software was gather all the rquirements and write code that followed standard OOP principlces and unit tests that provided over 80% code coverage.
